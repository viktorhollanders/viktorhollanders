        <p class="about-content">
          There are two things that have always inspired me: being able to build something from
          scratch and the freedom to work from anywhere. When I discovered programming eight years
          ago, I found that it was the perfect fit for both. I pursued it on and off until three
          years ago when I got more into web development, and then a year ago, I decided to go all
          in and started studying computer science at Reykjavik University.

        <p class="about-content">
          I have a keen interest in well-designed products that have good user experience and
          aesthetic appeal. As a developer, I am interested in cloud computing and the development
          of mobile and web applications. Besides that, I have a passion for being outside and
          taking photos, as well as making good coffee.
